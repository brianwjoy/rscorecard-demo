::: notes
Stemmed from Obama Administration aim to create a federal ratings system The 2015 version primarily compiled existing data 2019 - comprehensive source of data for institution and program level earnings data Personally, I am concerned that we are on a policy trajectory that focuses too narrowly on earnings (easy to measure)
